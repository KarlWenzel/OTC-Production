Decline curve analysis of horizontal oil and gas wells in Oklahoma

### Goals:

Determine the statewide average percentage decline in gross production volume from January 2012 to the most recent month in 2017 in the data for all horizontal oil wells combined and horizontal gas wells combined during the wells' first year, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years. This would appear to mean calculating those percentages for each well and then averaging the percentages (for 1 year, 18 months etc.).

The first step, I would say, is to get all of the data in clean columns and rows, with each row being a well identified by a PUN number. Perhaps the size of the files would mean breaking them up into separate ones in order to manipulate. The Tax Commission provided files for the most recent 12 months, most recent 36 months, and all years going back to 1990, as I understand.

One issue is how to identify the horizontal wells. I am told that any PUN number ending with an H is a horizontal. Also any well with a qualifying tax rate of 1% is horizontal. After July 1, 2015, both horizontal and vertical wells were taxed at 2%, so the only way to distinguish between the two is with the H at the end of the number.
